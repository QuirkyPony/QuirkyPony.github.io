# QuirkyPony
Hello, World! this is my GitHub Pages site, for people wanting to know about me and my projects!

## My Projects
As for my projects, I have currently this rather small [shell lock screen](https://quirkypony.giyhub.io/shell-lock-screen) thingy going, however, it is pretty much done, so I am looking for some other things to do. I already have some things in mind, which would fit nicely with me learning java.

## Me
As for me myself, I want to stay mostly anonymous. I can, however tell you that I go to school, know some computer programming, some bash and **definitely** despise MS Windows because of it's lack of a competitive command shell with all the necessary utilities straight out of the box, which is ironic as my classmates continuously accuse me of hacking the computer, when I in reality, am not even able to do much else than cd around the filesystem. And yes, I know PowerShell, which was designed to fix some of this, but, again, it lacks out-of-the-box functionality.
